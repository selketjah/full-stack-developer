# Becoming a full stack developer: a quest into the unknown

A lot of developers, including myself, believe that a full stack developer is a myth. But front-end development has changed a lot and the introduction of Babel and Elm have pushed it in a new direction. So it is time to reinvestigate if it is possible to be one.

In this talk I will share my experience with getting back into front-end development, more specifically the Fable ecosystem, after leaving it behind for a long time: how creating a front-end is different from creating a back-end, which parts of learning it was easy and which parts were hard and how thinking about code aesthetics changes the way you write code in general.
